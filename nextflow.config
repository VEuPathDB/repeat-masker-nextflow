// rmParams "-species" will not work due to dfam files not containing full library. These would be to large to include in container. Instead, I will be adding a parameter, libraryPath. This will be used to set an environment variable LIBDIR, which repeatMasker will use. If you are running this locally, or only want to use the curated versions of the databases, you can just leave it as /opt/RepeatMasker/Libraries. If you want to data that does not come standard, please supply the path to the RepeatMasker libraries.
